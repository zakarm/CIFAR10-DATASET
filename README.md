# CIFAR10-DATASET
The CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) dataset is a collection of labeled images that is widely used in the field of computer vision for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. There are two main versions of the CIFAR dataset:

1. CIFAR-10: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

2. CIFAR-100: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. The classes are grouped into 20 superclasses, each containing 5 subclasses.

The CIFAR dataset is often used as a benchmark for image classification algorithms because of its relatively small size and simplicity compared to other datasets such as ImageNet. It is commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The CIFAR dataset has been used in a wide range of research areas, including object recognition, image segmentation, image restoration, and generative models. Many machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, provide built-in functions to download and load the CIFAR dataset for training and testing machine learning models.
